# US-Diabetes-Data-Analysis-Project

This is a summarized website of a semester-long data analysis project -- diabetes in the US. 

We used Python, machine learning models, and visualization tools (python library and Tableau).

I didn't include all python source files in this repo, just the data science story here.

A snapshot of our conclusion:

# Some notes
I feel like this topic is important and it deserves more attention. The project's data source cannot be changed after they were initially picked (by me), which caused a lot of headaches afterwards. Our data is not very suitable for certain machine learning tasks, but it is good to practice.

# Credits
This is a collaborative project of four, me and my three lovely classmates -- Yiwei, Jianning and Yiyang.
